#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle .emacs.d/init.el

This is an ongoing evolution of my original Emacs configuration files, inspired by a bunch of resources I've found online.

* Startup Performance

Make startup faster by reducing the frequency of garbage collection and then use a hook to measure Emacs startup time.

Also, turn on =lexical-binding= for the init file!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

  ;; The default is 800 kilobytes.  Measured in bytes.
  (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 50 1000 1000))

  ;; Profile emacs startup
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
            (lambda ()
              (message "*** Emacs loaded in %s with %d garbage collections."
                       (format "%.2f seconds"
                               (float-time
                                (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time)))
                       gcs-done)))

#+end_src

* Native Compilation
